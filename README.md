# yolo-smart-vision-app
A real-time YOLOv8 Object Detection app supporting both image and video analysis. Built with Python, OpenCV, and a lightweight UI for seamless inference.
This project implements a real-time object detection system capable of analyzing images and videos using the YOLOv8 model.
It draws bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores on detected objects with high accuracy.
Whether you’re testing single images or running full video pipelines, this app offers a smooth and intuitive experience.
